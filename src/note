    Maven
This lets you declare all the dependencies you need in a single file(pom.xml).

    Creating a Project using spring boot
1)Create a maven project
steps
1)click file, new , project and select maven.
GroupId is like the package name
ArtifactId is like the project name - course-api
name- Java Brains Course Api
-add the <parent> project to convert the maven project to a fully functional spring boot project.
meaning the course_api project is now a child of <Parent>
The <parent> contains spring boots configuration and it automatically adds it to the child i.e our project
2)add required <dependency> inside the <dependencies> tag
3)Create a javaclass that is the starting point(run) of our application
Annotate the javaclass with @SpringBootApplication
create a main method and add this code inside the main method
SpringApplication.run(Classname.class, the main class arguemnt);
4)adding a controller
A controller in spring is a class with the @Controller annotation.
