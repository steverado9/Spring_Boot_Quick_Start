    What is Spring boot?
Spring is the Spring framework.
Spring Framework is an enterprise java framework that lets you write java applications.
SpringBoot is a bootstrap or a way to quickly create a spring application.

    Official definition of Spring boot
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

    Spring
This is an Application framework that helps you build enterprise java applications.
    Problems with Spring
1)It is a huge framework.
2)Multiple setup steps.
3)Multiple configuration steps.
4)Multiple build and deploy steps.
    Spring Boot
1)Opinionated : It gives you a good starting point.
2)Convention over Configuration.
3)Stand alone: You can just run a spring boot application.
4)Production ready.
    Maven
This lets you declare all the dependencies you need in a single file(pom.xml).

    Creating a Project using spring boot
1)Create a maven project
steps
1)click file, new , project and select maven.
GroupId is like the package name
ArtifactId is like the project name - course-api
name- Java Brains Course Api
-add the <parent> project to convert the maven project to a fully functional spring boot project.
meaning the course_api project is now a child of <Parent>
The <parent> contains spring boots configuration and it automatically adds it to the child i.e our project
2)add required <dependency> inside the <dependencies> tag
3)Create a javaclass that is the starting point(run) of our application
Annotate the javaclass with @SpringBootApplication
create a main method and add this code inside the main method
SpringApplication.run(Classname.class, the main class arguemnt);
4)adding a controller
A controller in spring is a class with the @RestController annotation.
In a controller, you can have methods that map to url request.
and the way to annotate a particular request to a particular method, we use
@RequestMapping and it takes the url as a parameter that it is supposed to map to.
The default method for a @RequestMpping is a GET request.

    Reasons why spring boot decided to have the Embedded Tomcat server
Tomcat server: This is the default Servlet container but can can be changed.
-Convenience
-Servlet container config is now application config(everything is now in one place).
-Standalone application

    Spring MVC controller
This handles our request and returns a view.
This controller matches our url and http method to something(method) that returns a view.

    Resources for our rest api
Topics, Courses, Lessons
    Standard for naming resources
Topics:
GET     /topics         Gets all topics
GET     /topics/id      Get the topic
POST    /topics         Create new topic
PUT     /topics/is      Updates the topic
DELETE  /topics/id      Delete the topic

    How to create a business service
By annotating the service class with @Service
@Autowired is used to tell spring that this variable needs to be injected

When making a post request on postman
go to the header
key             value
content-type application/json
